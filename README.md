# Tower of Hanoi Project - Computer Graphics Course @Polimi (AY 2020-2021)

## Introduction
The Tower of Hanoi is a mathematical puzzle. It consists of three rods and a number of discs (in our case 4 discs) of different sizes,
which can slide onto any rod. The puzzle starts with the discs in a stack in ascending order of size on the first rod,
the smallest at the top, thus making a conical shape.

The objective of the game is to move the entire stack to another rod, obeying the following simple rules:
1. Only one disc can be moved at a time.
2. Each move consists of taking the upper disc from one of the rods and placing into another rod.
3. No disc can be placed on top of a smaller disc.

## Shading Space
The shading space adopted in this project is WORLD SPACE.

## Projection Type
The projection type adopted in this project is PERSPECTIVE PROJECTION.

## Ways of control
1. You could drag the screen by mouse to adjust the view
2. You could click buttons on the web page to move discs
3. You could also press keys denoted in texts of buttons to move discs instead of clicking buttons.
