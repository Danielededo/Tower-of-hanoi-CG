# Tower of Hanoi Project - Computer Graphics Polimi 2021

## Introduction
The Tower of Hanoi is a mathematical game or puzzle. It consists of three rods and a number of discs of different sizes,
 which can slide onto any rod. The puzzle starts with the discs in a neat stack in ascending order of size on one rod, 
 the smallest at the top, thus making a conical shape.

The objective of the game is to move the entire stack to another rod, obeying the following simple rules:
1. Only one disc can be moved at a time.
2. Each move consists of taking the upper disc from one of the stacks and placing it on top of another stack.
3. No disc may be placed on top of a smaller disc.

## Ways of control
1. You could drag the screen by mouse to adjust the view
2. You could click buttons on the web page to move discs
3. You could also press keys denoted in texts of buttons to move discs instead of clicking buttons.
